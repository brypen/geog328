### **Origins**

As one of Seattle's oldest areas, the Central District underwent and represented immense change ever since its settlement by white colonists during the mid 1800s. Each decade often echoes its predecessors in both exploitation and development, with the area being home to vast communities as well as continued oppression. Stolen from the Duwamish and Suquamish people utilizing the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, what would become the Central District began as a major lumber yard ran by Henry Yesler. It, as well as the greater Seattle area, would struggle for several decades until the 1890s when the Northern Pacific Railway was constucted. The population began to boom, and by 1910 the population was 237,194 in all of Seattle.

### **Demographics**

Throughout most of its history, the Central District was predominantly native born white. However, it also served as a multicultural community and would later become the Black hub of Seattle. During its early years, however, it fostered a vibrant Jewish population along Yesler Way. By 1910, 7,000 Japanese lived within Seattle, many residing in the Central District. The Japanese population would represent the most prominent non-white ethnic group for the city for nearly half a century. Chinese, Filipino, Black, and Foreign-born whites also had signifigant populations within the area. During WWII, Japanese internment drastically reduced the Japanese population in Seattle, and its Black population grew due to wartime industry. By 1960, over 90% of the Central District's schools were Black. The population boom was due to a myriad of reasons, most notably the presence of racial restrictive covenants in other regions of Seattle as well as the abundance of relatively affordable homes in the distrct. By the 80s, gentrification had begun in the distirct, and the Black population dramatically decreased.

### **Legacy**

Seattle's Central District will always be remembered as a multicultural, vibrant community that consisted of many different communities. Each one came together to form a neighborhood with rich charm, traditions, economics, and landscape. Throughout the district are multicultural centers, museums, and parks celebrating the vibrant past, as well as future, of the community. Much of civil rights, Black power, and other groups were and are active in the district. Despite continued oppression and removal of populations, the community who truly made up Seattle's Central District built up a community and perservered.
